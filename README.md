# TictactoeAngular

Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (Commonwealth English), or Xs and Os/“X’y O’sies” (Ireland), is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner. It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.


In order to win the game, a player must place three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.

The following example game is won by the first player, X:

Players soon discover that the best play from both parties leads to a draw. Hence, tic-tac-toe is most often played by young children, who often have not yet discovered the optimal strategy.
